Version 1.2

If you have troubles with the timer, please use !toggleDebug and then use the timer to the point of error again then upload that with your issue.
Only commands not listed in setup are !toggleDebug and !checkDebug. All others are customizable in settings and should either be left as default or setup by the streamer and they notify admins of the commands.
All commands require admin privlage to run

Currently the debug only prints out the debug label and not the stack trace. Will be fixed in next version but debuging will still be doable without it
